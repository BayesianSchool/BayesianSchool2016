# Guide to Hacking

Hack days, also known as unconferences, hackathons and (in some circles) JEDI, are a fun way to make rapid progress in research and learn a lot in the process. 

What's the idea? A good project or hack is a simple problem with a clear goal on which significant progress can be made over the course of the hackathon. Hack sessions are unstructured and self-organising. There are no lectures or talks, your time is your own. Teamwork is key so either propose a project others can join or join an existing project to which you think you can contribute.

Remember to keep the hacks you propose simple and goal-oriented as time is always limited. Good hacks include: creating tutorials, outlining a theoretical solution to a problem to be later implemented and very short research projects.  The idea is to make rapid progress on a small, bite-sized problem and to make use of the expertise of people attending the school. 

Rules of a hackathon:

1. Add your project ideas to the project proposal hackpad before we start
2. At the beginning of the hackathon, everyone who proposed a hack gets a couple of minutes to stand up and "advertise" their project to the rest of the participants
3. Each project should have a very clear, achievable goal 
4. Groups are self-organising, where people interested in the same project work together. You can work on more than one hack, but try not to spread yourself too thin! 
5. At the end of hackathon, every group will present the results of their hack. Each group should have produced something that they can show the rest of the participants, examples include: code, a plot, the beginnings of a paper, an outline of a future project etc.
6. Have fun!
