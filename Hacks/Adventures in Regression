This hack has two independent parts that can be tackled either separately or together: 

* Explore Bayesian regression for fitting data with y-errors (the usual case) and with some data points for which there are 
only upper/lower limits (survival analysis). In the case of linear regression are there simple formulae for the best fits? 

* Imagine data for which the y values are know (with some known error bars) but the x-values have a probability distribution 
which is multi-modal. The limit of this is when the pdf for the x-data is made of a sum of Dirac delta functions. For linear regression 
are there elegant analytical functions that generalise the usual formulae?
